## Responsive Timeline Project – Stage 1
This project is the first stage of building a responsive, semantic, and polished HTML/CSS timeline layout. It sets up the core HTML structure with placeholders for future styling and interactive features.

## Stage 1 Goals
Establish semantic HTML structure for maintainability and accessibility.

Include essential containers and placeholders required for the upcoming responsive timeline and modal functionalities.

Prepare for styling and JavaScript integrations in later stages.

Current Structure (index.html)
<header>: Contains a placeholder logo element and a theme toggle button.

<nav> or filter container: Reserved for future timeline filtering or categorizing options (currently empty).

<section id="timeline">: Timeline container where event markers will be placed in future stages.

<div id="modal">: Empty placeholder for popup details and event information (will be hidden and styled later).

Semantic HTML Elements:

<main> to wrap the main timeline content.

<article> and <figure> ready for individual event content once data is added.
