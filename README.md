# Timeline of Computer Development - Nakulan JS

## Project Overview

This is a clean, semantic, single-page HTML timeline application that highlights key milestones in the history of computer development. The project emphasizes accessible and well-structured markup using semantic HTML5 elements, with minimal styling applied through CSS for a clear and readable layout.

The timeline features important computing events from the 1940s through 2007, each accompanied by images and short descriptions to provide historical context.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML Structure:** Utilizes `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, and `<figcaption>` tags to enhance accessibility and content meaning.
- **Timeline Events:** Chronologically arranged milestones including ENIAC, UNIVAC I, IBM 701, Apple I, IBM PC 5150, Macintosh, and Apple iPhone.
- **Static Theme Toggle:** A toggle checkbox labeled "Theme: Black / White" is included in the header as a visual placeholder for future theme switching functionality (currently non-functional).
- **Responsive Layout:** Basic responsiveness so the site adapts nicely on smaller screens.
- **Placeholder Navigation:** A `<nav>` area reserved for future filters or search functionality.
- **Modal Container:** An empty modal `<div>` prepared for future pop-up or interactive features.
- **No JavaScript:** This stage has no JavaScript, providing a simple and lightweight static page focused on markup and basic styling.

## Usage

1. **Open `index.html`** in any modern web browser to view the timeline.
2. The images must be located in the same directory as the HTML file (or update paths accordingly).
3. The theme toggle checkbox is currently just a UI element and does not change the page style.
4. Future updates may add interactive features like theme toggling, filters, and pop-ups.

## Project Goals

- Provide a semantic, accessible timeline app foundation.
- Maintain a straightforward, human-readable codebase ideal for gradual enhancement.
- Facilitate extensions such as theming, filtering, and interactive modals in future stages.

## File Structure

- `index.html` â€” Main app markup.
- Image files for timeline events (e.g., `eniac.jpg`, `univac.jpg`, `macintosh.jpg`, `iphone.png`, etc.).
